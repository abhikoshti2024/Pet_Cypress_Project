# Bug [#1]None of the Main Navigation Bar Items Navigate to the Correct Page

## Description

4. Click on one of the main navigation bar items (e.g., "PROMOTIONS," "PRODUCTS," "BLOG").

## Expected Behavior

After clicking on a main navigation bar item, the application should navigate the user to the corresponding page associated with that menu item.
